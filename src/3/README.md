# Chapter 3: Stacks & Queues

## Content

A brief chapter on stacks and queues and how to implement them. These are pretty straightforward data structures. The book implemented them with a linked list in behind the scenes.

I implemented my own version of a [Stack](Stack.ts) and [Queue](Queue.ts).

### Exercises:

* Stack Min
* Set of Stacks
* Implementing a Queue with 2 Stacks
* Sort Stack
* Animal Shelter
